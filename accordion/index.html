        <button class="accordion">How much time I need to dedicate to this business?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>At the beginning, at least 2-3 hours in total to fill out all the applications, Google Forms, Documents, Information for the Tax Exemption, Company Information, etc. The first month you will need to be aware of the email for any documents that are needed to continue with Tax Exemption. These documents are certificates that arrive for your company, which you will need to scan or send by mail to one of our employees who we will assign to take care of the entire process of being Tax Exempted. Another time that you should dedicate to the business is when receiving payments. Once you receive the payments from Amazon every (14) days, you must pay your Credit Card, and pay the Invoices that we will send you from the 30% or 40% Performance Fee (Depending on the contract you have: 60/40 or 70/30). </p>
